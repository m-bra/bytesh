 * introduce persistent variables
   only char[] type allowed.
   after user once commanded
    $ #pers char varname[256];
   every compilation for each future command will load the persistent variables as follows:
    $ char varname[256]; (as global variable)
    $ fgetsclose(varname, sizeof(varname), fopen(".../varname.txt", "r"));
   and save each persistent variable as
    $ fputsclose(varname, fopen(".../varname.txt", "w"));
